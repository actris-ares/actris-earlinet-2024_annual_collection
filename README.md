# ACTRIS-EARLINET 2024 ANNUAL COLLECTION

This dataset collects all the aerosol optical property profiles collected in 2024 at ACTRIS aerosol remote sensing stations.

This collection contains for each station: 
- all the aerosol backscatter profiles at 352, 532 e 1064nm
- all the aerosol extinction profiles  at 352, 532
- all the particle depolarization ratio profiles at 352, 532 e 1064nm.
  
This dataset is an incremental dataset: data are added until the end of 2024 as soon as a new observation is added on the ACTRIS/EARLINET database.
